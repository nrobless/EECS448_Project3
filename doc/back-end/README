This file contains a description of the backend contained in the project
back-end directory. 

backEnd/cgi-bin/
	Files in here should be installed in a directory that apache can execute
	Perl scripts from. These are the end points that any front ends will use
	to communicate with the game.

backEnd/cgi-bin/ticTacToeCommand.cgi
	The end point to send commands into a game. This process will communicate
	with the game through the named socket that the game creates at 
	back-end/gameFiles/1234567890

backEnd/cgi-bin/ticTacToeStart.cgi
	Call the URL pointing to this file to start off the game on the web server
	as a long lived process. This web page does not need to be kept open.
	If any file exists at back-end/gameFiles/die games will not run, and any active
	game will stop running. back-end/gameFiles/deathOut will catch any error
	messages if the game dies unexpectedly.


backEnd/gameLobby.pl
	The main process that is started by backEnd/cgi-bin/ticTacToeStart.cgi.
	Much of the functionality is contained in the modules, but this file handles
	listening on the socket at back-end/gameFiles/1234567890 for incomming connection,
	Then reading from those connections and processing commands from them.
	It then calls into the modules/Command.pm modules to execute them.
	If file back-end/gameFiles/die exists, this will stop running the next frame.
	

backEnd/modules
	The modules that the main script calls into. Most of the heavy lifting
	is done within these. Described in doc/backEnd/modules.


backEnd/log.txt
	The log file for the backend. While some information is sent back over
	the http response, more in-depth information is stored here.
	This file will be created automatically and does not need to be copied over.
	Its location may be changed by editing:
		backEnd/modules/Conf.pm => $conf{'logFile'}

backEnd/tests/P1.html
backEnd/tests/P2.html
	These html pages are very crude front-ends that can be used to test the back-end.
	By clicking on the buttons provided a ticTacToe game is simulated.
	These files will not start the gameLobby, that needs to be done manually.
